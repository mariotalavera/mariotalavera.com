I am Mario Talavera, an engineer interested in turning data into actionable intelligence.

I am the Data Engineer at <a href="https://www.sensorthink.com" target="_blank">SensorThink</a>.  We use our IOT platform to automate warehouses, make buildings smart and reduce costs.

At <a href="https://www.oracle.com" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, I worked on <a href="https://www.oracle.com/applications/knowledge-management.html" target="_blank">Knowledge Management</a> on the <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/home" target="_blank">Oracle Cloud</a>.  Before that, I used to work in Analytics on <a href="https://www.oracle.com/applications/rightnow/engage/knowledge/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle's Service Cloud</a>.

Prior to Oracle, I was a data developer working for multiple companies in Central Florida.  I am also a <a href="https://www.ucf.edu">UCF</a> Alumni.

In my free time, I like to spend time with my family, go for a run and solve interesting problems.
